# AI for Software Development Day 2 Morning Workshop

## Learning Objectives

- Work with GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- Learn how to create React Projects to solve specific problems using Copilot
- Do the same for Angular Projects
- Investigate using Copilot with Java and .net Projects

### Morning Session

We looked at using Copilot with vanilla JavaScript projects yesterday, this morning you are going to investigate using it with React and Angular projects.

#### Things to try

1. Can Copilot generate a full empty React Project for you with some basic naming? (Similar to what Vite and create-react-app do)
2. Compare the results from Copilot with what you get when you use Vite. Which is better? Why?
3. Using your preferred method to generate a React app can you then use Copilot to generate a version of the ToDo List application?
   1. How easy is it?
   2. What works well? What doesn't?
   3. How far can you get just using Copilot? How much manual intervention is required?
4. Using your experience so far, try and generate as much of a solution for the Cohort Dashboard Challenge as you can, do not overwrite your existing solutions.
5. What other exercises can you generate reasonable solutions for?

After you've spent a few hours playing with Copilot and React move on to repeat the process with Angular.

Link some of you solutions below (don't overwrite your existing solutions), fork this repo and make a PR as previously.
